# Analyse-NYSE-data-with-excel
In this project I have used the New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset from kaggle that contains historical financial data.
My intention of this project is to showcase my Excel skills and little bit of statistics. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate following:

1] Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread.
2] Use a combination of Excel (e.g.,Pivot table, IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
3] Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel.
4] Create visualizations and a financial forecast model using Excel.
