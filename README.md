# Analyse-NYSE-data-with-excel
In this project I have used the New York Stock Exchange S&P 500 dataset from kaggle that contains historical financial data.
My intention of this project is to showcase my Excel skills and little bit of statistics. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate following:

1] Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread.
2] Use a combination of Excel (e.g.,Pivot table, IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
3] Analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel.
4] Create visualizations and a financial forecast model using Excel.

In the project I have compared two categorical variables i.e, Industrials and Healthcare with the total revenue(quantitative variable) during year 3.
If i have summarize quickly, for Measure of Centre, the mean for healthcare is higher than that of industrials. However, the median for industrials is higher than healthcare. Also, for Measure of spread part, quickly comparing using standard deviation suggest that, it is higher for healthcare which inturn shows higher spread. Also, shape of data of both suggests a right skewed shape on histogram.
